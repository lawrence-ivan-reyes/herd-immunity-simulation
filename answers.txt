Q1: What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
A1:
- Population size: 1000
- Percent vaccinated: 10%
- Virus name: Sniffles
- Mortality rate: 0.12
- Reproductive rate: 0.5

Q2: What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
A2:
- Total infections: 620 (at Step 4 before virus burned out)
- Total population: 1000
- Percentage infected = (Total infections / Total population) * 100
- Percentage infected = (620 / 1000) * 100 = 62%

Q3: What percentage of the population died from the virus?
A3:
- Total deaths: 112
- Total population: 1000
- Percentage died = (Total deaths / Total population) * 100
- Percentage died = (112 / 1000) * 100 = 11.2%

Q4: Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
A4:
- Vaccination saves (based on logs): At various steps, the total number of vaccinated increased, which saved potential infections.
  - Step 1: 1
  - Step 2: 3 - 1 = 2
  - Step 3: 6 - 3 = 3
  - Step 4: 15 - 6 = 9
  - Step 5: 338 - 15 = 323
  - Step 6: 788 - 338 = 450
- Sum of saved interactions (Vaccine saves) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 9 + 323 + 450 = 788
