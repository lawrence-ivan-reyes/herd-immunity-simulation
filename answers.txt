Q1: What were the inputs you gave the simulation? 
    (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
A1:
    - Population size: 1000
    - Percent vaccinated: 10%
    - Virus name: Sniffles
    - Mortality rate: 0.12
    - Reproductive rate: 0.5

Q2: What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
A2:
    - Total Infected: 791 individuals
    - Percentage of population infected: 79.1%

Q3: What percentage of the population died from the virus?
A3:
    - Total Dead: 109 individuals
    - Percentage of population died: 10.9%  

Q4: Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
A4:
    - Total Vaccine Saves: 791 times
