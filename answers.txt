Q1: What were the inputs you gave the simulation? 
    (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

A1:
    - Population size: 1000
    - Percent vaccinated: 10%
    - Virus name: Sniffles
    - Mortality rate: 0.12
    - Reproductive rate: 0.5

Q2: What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

A2:
    - Total infections: 619 (at Step 4 before virus burned out)
    - Total population: 1000
    - Percentage infected:
      (Total infections / Total population) * 100
      (619 / 1000) * 100 = 61.9%

Q3: What percentage of the population died from the virus?

A3:
    - Total deaths: 103
    - Total population: 1000
    - Percentage died:
      (Total deaths / Total population) * 100
      (103 / 1000) * 100 = 10.3%

Q4: Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?

A4:
    - Vaccination saves (based on logs): At various steps, the total number of vaccinated increased, which saved potential infections.
      - Step 1: 1
      - Step 2: 3 - 1 = 2
      - Step 3: 7 - 3 = 4
      - Step 4: 18 - 7 = 11
      - Step 5: 335 - 18 = 317
      - Step 6: 797 - 335 = 462
    - Sum of saved interactions (Vaccine saves):
      1 + 2 + 4 + 11 + 317 + 462 = 797
